2.	As a hardcore pc gamer, I want to order and keep track of what games I play least first so I can play what games I haven’t accessed in a while.
3.	As an entry level pc gamer, I want to be able to find games that are similar to what I play, so I can explore more of what I like or dislike in a gaming genre.
